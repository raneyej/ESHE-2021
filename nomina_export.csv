<p>On possible explanation for the closure is that Ferguson may have appealed on the basis that Abloff 1908 as cited in Campbell (1963) makes no mention of Homo antiquus. This is due to an error in Campbell where the wrong citation is listed. There are two publications for Abloff 1908, one is a short article in Anat. Anz. which is cited by Campbell (1965) but which does not contain the description of Homo antiquus. However, in that Adloff article he mentions a book he published that same year (1908). That book, &quot;Das Gebiss des Menschen und der Anthropomorphen Vergleichend-anatomische Untersuchungen Zugleich ein Beitrag zur menschlichen Stammgeschichte&quot; does contain the description for Homo antiquus.

14,Australopithecus afarensis,FALSE,,"<p>Johanson, White and Coppens (1978) coined the name <em>Au. afarensis</em> with LH 4 as the type and Garusi 1 as a paratype. Garusi 1 itself is a type specimen described by Weinert (1950) as <em>Meganthrpus africanus.</em>&nbsp;Johanson, White and Coppens (1978) recognized Garusi 1 and the rest of the hypodigm as fitting within the genus <em>Australopithecus</em>, however transfering the name <em>Meganthropus africanus</em> to the genus <em>Australalopithecus</em> creates a homonym with <em>Australpoithecus africans</em> Dart, 1925, which prompted Johanson, White and Coppens (1978) to coin the new name <em>Australopithecus afarensis&nbsp;</em>Johanson, White and Coppens 1978. However, while their paper was in press it was preempted by a scientific news announcement published by Hinrichsen (1978) in which the author announced the name <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em> and attributed it to Johanson alone. Day et al. (1980) have argued that Henrichsen (1978) meets the criteria for a valid nomenclatural act and thus the formal name for this taxon should be <em>Australpithecus afarensis</em> Johanson, 1978 (in Henrichsen, 1978). The sequence of events is also summarized in Kimbel and Delzene (2009).</p>

<p>Heinrichs (1978) did not name a holotype, thus the subsequent holotype designation by Johanson et al. 1978 is technically a lectotype designation (a lectotype denotes a type specimen designated subsequent to the publication of the name).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Groves (1996) formally requested that the ICZN supress the name <em>Meganthropus africanus</em> and grant priority to <em>Australopithecus afarensis</em>. This appeal was made in case number 2998, with comments from White et al. (1998) and approved by ICZN in 1999&nbsp;as opinion number&nbsp;1941. In their final opinion, the ICZN ruled that the name africanus Weinert 1950 is formally supressed for the purposes of the Principle of Priority but not for those of the Principle of Homonymy. The same ruling also acknowledged the name afarensis, Johanson 1978 with the specimens L.H. 4 as the lectotype.</p>

<p>Strait et al.
